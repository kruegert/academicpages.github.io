I am a postdoctoral researcher in visual analytics, currently employed at Harvard University, Cambridge MA, USA. 
My research focuses on information visualization and visual analytics techniques and systems.

Visual analytics is an emerging research field to tackle big data analysis challenges. 
It creates added value by combining the processing power and accuracy of machines with human capabilities to perceive information visually. 
Automatic means are used to fuse and aggregate data and to detect hidden patterns therein. 
Interactive visualizations allow to explore and query the data and to steer the automatic processes with domain knowledge. 
This increases trust in data, models, and results, which is especially important when critical decisions need to be made. 
The strengths of visual analytics have been shown to be particularly advantageous when problems and goals are underspecified and exploratory means are needed to discover yet unknown patterns. 
My specific fields of research comprise the analysis of mobility/movement data and social media data. 
Furthermore, I work on predictive analytics approaches. 
Recently, connectomics and immersive analytics became a new field of interest.
