<p style="font-size:14px;width:600px;text-align:justify">I am a postdoctoral researcher in visual analytics, currently employed at Harvard University, Cambridge MA, USA. 
  My research focuses on information visualization and visual analytics techniques and systems.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;width:600px;text-align:justify">Visual analytics is an emerging research field to tackle big data analysis challenges. 
It creates added value by combining the processing power and accuracy of machines with human capabilities to perceive information visually. 
Automatic means are used to fuse and aggregate data and to detect hidden patterns. 
Interactive visualizations allow to explore and query the data and to steer automatic processes with domain knowledge. 
This increases trust in data, models, and results, which is especially important when critical decisions need to be made. 
The strengths of visual analytics have been shown to be particularly advantageous when problems and goals are underspecified and exploratory means are needed to discover yet unknown patterns.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;width:600px;text-align:justify">My specific fields of research comprise the analysis of spatio-temporal data, especially <a href="#movementAndMobilityAnalytics" style="color:#33ccff;">mobility/movement data</a>, <a href="#socialMediaAnalytics" style="color:#33ccff;">social media data</a>, and most recently <a href="#Connectomics" style="color:#33ccff;">connectome data</a>. 
Further research projects include <a href="#predictiveAnalytics" style="color:#33ccff;">predictive analytics</a> and <a href="#immersiveAnalytics" style="color:#33ccff;">immersive analytics approaches</a>, and a <a href="#webBasedVisualizationFramework" style="color:#33ccff;">web/based visualization frameworks</a>.
Here is a selection of my projects:</p>

<div id="movementAndMobilityAnalytics" class="researchTopic">
<b>Movement and Mobility Analytics</b>
<p style="font-size:14px;width:600px;text-align:justify">The research forcuses on novel visual analytics approaches to derive meaning and reasons behind movement, by taking into account recent big data challenges (i.e., increasing volume, veracity, variety, velocity). We develop and evaluate novel means regarding all steps in the analysis process from data retrieval, enrichment, exploration, and verification to externalization of gained knowledge for various fields of application such as electric mobility, event management, and law enforcement. We leverage geo-located social media data to extract up-to-date movement information, but also to enrich movement trajectories from other sources with structured and unstructured information about places, events, transactions, and other observations. Through highly interactive visual interfaces analysts can bring in domain knowledge to deal with uncertainties during data fusion and to steer the subsequent semantic analysis. We work on exploratory and confirmatory analysis techniques to create hypotheses, refine them, and find support in the data. For example, we developed a spatial filtering method using a set-based focus+context technique and a more abstract visual query language to allow explicitly formulate, extract, and query for movement patterns. To cope with the vast amounts of data the visual interfaces are coupled with automatic pattern detection methods to analyze routines and abnormal behavior.</p>
